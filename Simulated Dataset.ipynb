    "### Variables to Simulate\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Wind Speed\n",
    "- <b>Description</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Wind is caused by air moving from high to low pressure, usually due to changes in temperature. The speed at which the air moves is the wind speed. It is sometimes measured in nautical miles per hour (knots) but for the purposes of this project it will be considered in metres/second (m/s). According to Met Eireann's records, the long-term average wind speed at Cork Airport is 10.4 knots. [1] This is equivalent to 5.35 m/s.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Likely distribution</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "When measuring wind speed, it can be observed that strong gale force winds occur rarely while moderate winds are much more common. Studies have concluded that the best probability density distribution for approximating hourly or 10 minute wind speeds at a site is the Weibull distribution. [2]\n",
    "    \n",
    "<img src = \"./Images/Weibull.png\">\n",
    "<center>[3]</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The Weibull probability distribution is a two-parameter function that is widely used in statistical analysis. Its two parameters are scale and shape. The scale relates to the long-term mean wind speed at the site and the shape factor can be calculated from the standard deviation of the dataset if known.\n",
    "\n",
    "The statistical distribution of wind speeds differs from site to site. It can be influenced by local climate, the landscape and topography. These can give different versions of a Weibull distribution with different mean values and shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the shape factor of a Weibull distribution is exactly 2, it is called a Rayleigh distribution. It has been shown that for mean wind speeds above 4 m/s, the Rayleigh distribution is an acceptable approximation for wind speed. [4] This is equivalent to a standard deviation of 52% of the mean wind speed.[5] This distribution is commonly used by wind turbine manufacturers to estimate the power that would be produced by a wind turbine at that particular site.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"./Images/Rayleigh.png\">\n",
    "<center>[6]</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The scale parameter for a Rayleigh wind distribution (c) can be calculated as 2/π x long-term average wind speed. [7]\n",
    "\n",
    "Python can produce an array of random numbers with a Rayleigh probability distribution using the numpy.random.rayleigh function, which accepts the scale factor and size of the output array as inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Air Temperature\n",
    "- <b>Description</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Air temperature is a measure of how hot or cold the air is. It the most commonly measured weather parameter and is measured in degrees Celsius. It causes gradients in atmospheric pressure which in turn causes wind to blow. According to Met Eireann's records, the long-term average temperature at Cork Airport is 9.65 degrees Celsius. [1]\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Likely distribution</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "It has been found that air temperature follows a normal or Gaussian distribution. [8][9] This is a bell shaped, symmetrical distribution widely used in statistics to describe quantitative random variables. It takes parameters of mean, which is the line of symmetry of the plot, and standard distribution, which determines the spread of the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"./Images/Normal.png\">\n",
    "<center>[9]</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean parameter for the distribution can be calculated from the monthly means provided by Met Eireann [1]. The standard deviation is taken from Ensemble of Regional Climate Model Projections for Ireland produced by the EPA [10]. Figure 2.17 of this report provides standard deviation of mean daily temperature values across Ireland by season. These values were built in to the model below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python can produce an array of random numbers with a normal probability distribution using the numpy.random.normal function, which accepts the mean, standard deviation and size of the output array as inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Atmospheric Pressure\n",
    "#### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "-Atmospheric pressure is the weight of air pressing down on the earth’s surface, measured in hectopascals. It is highest at sea level and decreases with height above the earth’s surface. Pressure depends on the density of the air which is determined by the air temperature. Pressure gradients cause air to flow in the form of wind. High pressure generally corresponds to calm, dry, warm weather whereas low pressure is associated with stormy, wet, cold weather. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Likely distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "-Atmospheric pressure is closely linked to wind speed and temperature, and as a result can be calculated using those values. Therefore, its distribution will be a function of their Rayleigh and Gaussian distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Season\n",
    "- <b>Description</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Wind speed, direction and atmospheric pressure will all vary with the time of year.\n",
    "\n",
    "To examine this, the 4th variable generated will be the season: spring, summer, autumn or winter.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Likely distribution</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "The 100 data points are taken at random across one year. As a result, each data point is equally as likely to occur in any of the 4 seasons. This is a uniform probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"./Images/Uniform.png\">\n",
    "<center>[11]</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Python can randomly select an element from an array of elements using numpy.random.choice. If probabilities for each element are not specified this function will assume a uniform probability distribution, which is suitable for our purposes. The function accepts as inputs the array from which selections are to be made and the size of the output array.\n",

    "## Relationships Between Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these variables is intrinsically linked to the others. By studying these interdependencies, we can generate a reasonable simulation of a dataset for this location.\n",
    "\n",
    "As can be seen from the Met Eireann monthly averages, wind speed and air temperature vary throughout the year and follow similar patterns each year. Wind speeds are highest in winter while air temperature is highest in summer. [1] This demonstrates the relationship between each of the variables with the season.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these observations, the relationships between the variables can be determined. It is assumed that the same probability distribution applies to a season as to a whole year. Mean values can be calculated across each season. This provides all necessary input parameters for Python’s NumPy package to generate realistic random values. In this way both wind speed and air temperature are linked to the season in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wind speed, air temperature and atmospheric pressure are also related to each other. High air temperature causes the density of the air to decrease. This reduces the pressure on the earth’s surface. In low pressure systems there are few pressure gradients which causes wind speeds to be low. \n",
    "\n",
    "By relating both wind speed and air temperature to season, an appropriate relationship is also created between wind speed and air temperature. In general, the model should show that high wind speeds coincide with low pressure for the most part.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once these variables have been generated, they can then be used to calculate the atmospheric pressure. In the paper Statistical Analysis of the Relationship Between Wind Speed, Pressure and Temperature [12], the author explores the relationships between these variables and derives an equation to represent this relationship for non-storm conditions. This relationship is displayed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"./Images/PressureEquation.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation is built in to the program below in order to calculate the pressure based on the randomly generated wind speeds and air temperatures."
